## [Don Syme](http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/don-syme): "F# Code I Love" (keynote)

* functional language for .Net, open-sourced, multi-platform, supported by F# foundation
* Fable - build tooling for JS (inspired by Babel)
* domain modeling enabled by language features, e.g. pipe operator (`f |> x1 |> x2 |> x3`), union types
* view functions (similar to Elm architecture)
* deconstructed object-oriented features

## [Yoav Luft](http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/yoav-luft): "Does Javascript Adopt Functional Programming?"

* it seems like community is slightly shifting towards declarative (not necessarily functional) approach
* imperative constructs are still widely used, while declarative ones are gaining popularity (including helper libs)

## [John Azariah](http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/john-azariah): "Empowering the Quantum revolution with Q#"

* problem examples:
  * cryptography (factorization)
  * modeling/simulation of the FeMoco molecule (biological nitrogen fixation: 65 electrons, 57 spacial orbits) requires more bytes than atoms in the universe

## [Brooklyn Zelenka](http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/brooklyn-zelenka): "Bridging the Divide: A Philosophy of Library Design"

* composition, orthogonality, structured abstraction
* types with default values
* the "flow" metaphor: pipes with exceptions
* surface simplicity has a cost of being complex in a large

## [Michael Newton](http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/michael-newton): "Elm, Fable, and the Practical Implications of Programming Language Philosophy"

* Fable: F# -> AST -> Babel
* Elm: own compiler written in Haskell

## [Andrey Kuzmin](https://twitter.com/unsoundscapes): "Fighting the laws of physics with Elm" (lightning talk)

* the [`elm-physics`](https://github.com/w0rm/elm-physics) repo

## [Kolja Wilcke](https://twitter.com/01k): "The Magic of Currying" (lightning talk)

* illustrated [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fq_--sLUn-oKcQ0NVsBKYeYraEh82a3H4gwWZYGR2Yg/)
