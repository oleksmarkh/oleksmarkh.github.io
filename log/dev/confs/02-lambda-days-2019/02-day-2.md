## [Thorsten Altenkirch](http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/thorsten-altenkirch): "Why Type Theory matters"

* HoTT is basically a new math based on functional programming
* skipping the math, it's still possible to write programs that say what they do (to the compiler) - in types

## [Tomasz Kowal](http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/tomasz-kowal): "Introduction to stateful property based testing"

* describing a model to test, defining its properties
* the model should be created using definitions and expectations, not by reimplementing the logic
* using shrinking for finding minimal breaking cases: reducing fixtures until the failing test begin to pass, making it clear what exactly is causing that test to fail

## [Ju Liu](http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/ju-liu): "Do Parsers dream of Electric Guitars?"

* using parsers (`elm/parser`) instead of RegExp, because:
  * it gives your code an ability to reason about extracted values
  * emits meaningful error messages
* rendering chords as SVG views, using "integer notation"
* example: https://github.com/Arkham/elm-chords

## [Anne Veinberg and Felipe Ignacio Noriega](http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/anne-veinberg): "The CodeKlavier CKalcuÆ›ator: a lambda calculus calculator for the piano"

* the [CodeKlavier](https://codeklavier.space/) project
* live performance

## [Michael Sperber](http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/michael-sperber): "Teaching Functional Programming"

* coming from SICP, going with Racket (and DrRacket IDE) and different (more bureaucratic) methodology instead: description -> signature -> ...
* [DeinProgramm](https://www.deinprogramm.de/)

## [Katarzyna Szymielewicz](http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/katarzyna-szymielewicz): "Users' privacy is in your hands!" (keynote)

[layers](https://qz.com/1525661/your-digital-identity-has-three-layers-and-you-can-only-protect-one-of-them/) of digital identity:
* "what you share": the content itself, reactions, tracked interactions
* "what your behavior tells them": contextual metadata, not necessarily shared consciously
* "what the machine thinks about you": algorithmically computed interpretations
