# Uncertainty driven development: burning mode

[slides](https://slidr.io/oleksmarkh/uncertainty-driven-development)

## some tags (unordered)

* #mindset #processes #practices
* #patterns #tooling #react ecosystem
* #lessons learned <- Queen's "Under Pressure" meme

## mindset

* OO vs. functional <- "why not both" meme
  * crucial misconception: "data + actions" vs. "data -> actions" aka "monsters vs. ninjas"
  * patterns vs. common sense -> (don't) turn into philosophical debates
* DDD
* art of staying "in the zone" <- no matter what

## process

* invest in it (carefully)
* define uncertainties
  * e.g. UI, business logic, scalability etc.
  * arrange feature workflow accordingly
  * revise constantly
* isolate/orchestrate dependencies: human and technical

### team/env setup

* role of producer <- (ninja) yellow duck (with superpowers)
* sharing/rotating responsibilities
* leveraging guilds <- Linux beards meme

### conventions

* terminology
  * promote semantics and purity in definitions
  * garden it <- mention RenÃ© Descartes
* spellcheck everywhere
* editorconfig
* (strict) linter
* patterns

### daily routines

* instant planning: "agenda" gist -> log repo + features Q&A gists -> issues
* "zero everything" principle: inbox, PRs, todos/comments, tabs

### backing issues/PRs

Package your work and ship it properly <- "ship shipping ships" meme

* outline scope and next steps after first commit
* optional templating <- example: transport layer refactoring
* keep granular: avoid Dragons and Moby Dicks <- meme
* use labels:"in progress", "needs review" etc.) and milestones (reflecting epics/OKRs)

### refactoring <- granulated vs. massive

* fighting the mess (long run): notes -> guidelines -> conventions + architecture
* gardening (short run): motivation + value -> acceptance criteria (scope) -> next steps (out of scope)

### testing/docs

* requirements validation
* intentionally breaking things: showcase robustness and predictability
* coverage distribution between layers: % == misleading
* reflect a purpose (WHY) everywhere (even in commit messages)
* create tests before addressing isolated fixes <- discipline vs. motivation

## but first things first

### API first

* your contract, source of truth for your state
* promote common guidelines <- mention http://zalando.github.io/restful-api-guidelines
* `swagger.yaml`: same language for all
* bridge non-RESTful cases elegantly
  * example: reporting (inversion of entities vs. metrics)
  * schema vs. convention <- mention https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr

### design first

* structure: maintain it
* visuals <- mention Zeplin

### mobile first

* even for the back-end mindset
* try to think offline: UX, performance

## architecture

* avoid frameworks, use libs instead <- don't let to tie you down
* cohesion vs. coupling <- reference "Simple made Easy" talk, put some Rich Hickey and "all the things" meme
* orchestrating complex things <- https://www.mosaic9.org

## React ecosystem

### React itself

* stateless components <- so freaking easy to comprehend
* component workflow: design -> breakdown -> basic layout/styling -> detail -> polish
* container workflow: API -> state -> proxy down + dispatch

### Redux and the others

* data flow as a "framework"
  * why to follow rules: immutability, purity
* more than a predictable state container
  * again, on terminology
    * state vs. store
    * actions vs. action creators
    * reducers
* solving UX issues by state design
  * bulk collections saving
  * keeping scroll position
  * navigation, history replay
* some patterns
  * routing as a part of application state
  * async actions: thunk vs. sagas
    * managing side effects <- the only possible place
    * where and what to dispatch <- keep clear separation of concerns
      * loading UX
      * error handling
    * how to interact with transport layer
      * abstract HTTP away vs. libs (`axios`, `superagent`)
  * collection manipulation
    * deriving subtle sub-collections vs. injecting flags into collection items
* how to organize <- mention `ducks-modular-redux`

## tooling

* know your boxes <- being boring again
  * Jira + Github: issues/PRs -> epics/milestones + labels (yep - colors are important)
  * tabs: browser, editor, tmux
* deployment and compliance/traceability
  * STUPS <- promote AWS workflow
* React + Redux devtools (log, diff, chart) <- short live demo?

## You Learn About It <- The Gathering meme

* do keep things in order <- Ordnungsamt
* do plan ahead (short and middle-term), share your predictable plans with others <- helps avoiding chaos
* do self-document code: folder structure, consistent naming, `React.PropTypes`
* do follow (detailed) REST error codes <- helps keeping communication precise
* do lint and unit test each commit: git/Github hooks <- `npm i husky`, CI and chat integrations
* do reflect on each single bug: WHY this happened vs. HOW it revealed
* do produce granular artifacts <- avoid blocking (yourself and the others) with PRs
* do test each PR manually <- try not to make it boring as hell
* do keep CI log concise but error messages explanatory
* don't ever commit broken code <- hard to trace unpredictable changes
* don't spam people <- communication channels
* don't stop mastering your tools: git, text editor, browser, issue tracker, chat etc.
* do fight the fatigue, don't get lost in apathy <- Lyapis Trubetskoy meme
  * don't ignore important surveys (e.g. http://stateofjs.com)
  * shape the future (ES7, API groups, W3C etc.)
* stand out and shout <- Dio meme `\../`
