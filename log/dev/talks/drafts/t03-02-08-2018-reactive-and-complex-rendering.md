## overview

**Leveraging and surpassing DOM (going WebGL), constructing animated scenes.**

(following an issue template)

* motivation <- starting with "why?"
* considerations
* acceptance criteria <- to have an illustrated overview
* steps:
  * use cases for visual programming
  * DOM and beyond: limitations, history, alternatives, standards
  * main players, design, APIs
  * demos
* @see: resources, tools

## what does "reactive" mean?

"a declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change. With this paradigm it is possible to express static (e.g., arrays) or dynamic (e.g., event emitters) data streams with ease, and also communicate that an inferred dependency within the associated execution model exists, which facilitates the automatic propagation of the changed data flow."

## whereis

(use cases)

* animation-heavy interfaces, where huge DOM is too expensive
* data visualization (a new specialization appeared recently - creative coders, data/generative artists)
* maps
  * dominating in geometry calculations
  * raster/vector tiles, layers
* players/editors
  * images (flesh colors, multiplied colors, transparency)
    * organizing metadata
    * preloading (4-pixel thumbnails)
    * cropping, streamlining the layout
  * media controls: audio, video
  * text with effects (typing, fonts, positioning, sizing, colors, etc.) <- [Blotter](https://blotter.js.org)
  * slideshow (combined content, multiple transitions)

## how to leave without the DOM?!

* no layering/cascading
* no event listeners
* no native usual styling

## failed/aged attempts

* Flash, Silverlight
* HTML5 features and WebGL instead

## abstractions

* application structure
  * render engine (render loop), world
  * scene, camera (vs. point of view)
  * navigation, interactions
  * helpers (stats: FPS/memory, visual debug)
* own/custom + libs/frameworks
  * d3 utils: [`d3-scale`](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale), [`d3-scale-chromatic`](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale-chromatic), [`d3-color`](https://github.com/d3/d3-color)
  * [`three.js`](https://threejs.org/docs) - a monolithic abstraction over WebGL with fallbacks and helpers
* alternative approaches, APIs:
  * [`regl`](https://github.com/regl-project/regl) - functional WebGL
  * [WebGL for Elm](https://github.com/elm-community/webgl) <- get back later when defining WebGL terms (really nice pipeline diagram)

## shortcuts and risks related to external modules (keeping healthy relationship with OSS)

* being comfortable on the "generic <-> specific" scale
* consistency (semantics/naming, configuration)
* maintenance burden
* contributing back (or riding aside of the road)
* licensing

## low-level APIs (WebGL, Shader Language)

* terms: shader (vertex, fragment), texture, attribute, uniform, etc.
* coords, colors, shapes construction (made of triangles): lines
* passing additional data: abusing textures (sprites and atlases, e.g: patterns in lines, offsets represented as pixel colors)

(reference "WebGL Fundamentals")

## OOP (state management, communication) + FP (state propagation, utils)

Controllable (isolated) state and data pipelines.

(https://twitter.com/mfeathers/status/29581296216)

* towards the reactive paradigm: observing, scheduling, queuing
* tooling: [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/intro/concepts.html), [RxJS](http://reactivex.io/intro.html)

## data processing (cleaning, calculations, conversions), ETL pattern

(example: https://github.com/oleksmarkh/music-stats)

## UI management (fancy term: orchestration)

* components (as a common way these days)
* layering, grouping, accessing (selecting, picking)

## styling

* approaches
  * CSS-like, style as a function of state (e.g. [`styled-components`](https://www.styled-components.com), [`styled-system`](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system), [`emotion`](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction))
  * custom "standards" (declarative DSL for creative development)
  * supporting an ability to use functions and access some granular state
* high-level styling patterns
  * theming (tools and examples: [`styled-tools`](https://github.com/diegohaz/styled-tools), [`typography.js`](https://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js))
  * responsiveness (restrictions) <- JS constraints vs. CSS media queries (no callbacks)
* testing, reasoning
  * is it possible to assert against layout (other than screenshot comparison)?
  * checking accessibility/usability <- [The Cassius Project](https://cassius.uwplse.org)

## performance (chasing 60 FPS, trying not to drain the battery)

* capabilities of modern browsers
* offloading the main thread (workers and related hassle: passing structured clones)
* DOM: avoiding repaints and reflows ([1](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/browser-reflow), [2](https://gist.github.com/paulirish/5d52fb081b3570c81e3a))
* pre-rendering, pre-cooking the data <- e.g. tiling
* lazy calculations, limited to viewport
* start/stopping the render loop (`cancelAnimationFrame()`)
* benchmarking

## final thoughts

* performance
  * benchmark from the very beginning
  * profile on multiple configurations
* docs
  * sometimes, docs are awful, incomplete, boring or entirely missing
  * encourage to document findings (contribute to official docs, keep tutorials updated, ask and answer SO questions)
